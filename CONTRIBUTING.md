# Contributing

I hope trying out metapxe has been worth it!
Could it be better? I am sure it could! Do you have ideas? My time is yours.

Any contribution is welcome, preferably if it adheres to the following principles, or can challenge them with a great argument
- This project is about simplicity. Is this contribution making things easier?
- Regardless of the implementation language, it is preferable to stick to the available standard library rather than an external dependency
    - In my humble experience this extends the life of a project by a lot, also reduces the amount of maintenance work. Coming up with code takes a lot of time, but keeping it runnable takes more time (The rest of the life of the project, as long as someone is running it)
- ipxe has a rich scripting language. It is not the purpose of this project to create a DSL, but to create the maximum possible abstraction between the input of the user, and the ipxe scripts
